# MyDailyWork-Task3

A web-based **Online Quiz Maker** developed as part of Task 3.  
Users can create quizzes (UI-based), browse available quizzes, take quizzes one question at a time, and view results.  
The application also includes basic user login and registration and is mobile responsive.

## Features
- Home page with options to create or take a quiz  
- Quiz creation form (UI based)  
- Quiz list page to browse quizzes  
- Quiz taking page (one question at a time)  
- Result page showing score and correct answer  
- User registration and login (basic)  
- Mobile responsive design  

## Technologies Used
- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript  
- localStorage  

## How It Works
1. User registers and logs in  
2. User selects a quiz from the quiz list  
3. A quiz question is displayed  
4. User selects an answer and submits  
5. Final score and correct answer are shown  

## Note
This project uses basic frontend JavaScript for learning purposes.  
Dynamic quiz saving and backend features can be added in the future.
